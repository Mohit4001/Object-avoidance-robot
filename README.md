# Object-avoidance-robot
ESP32  object Avoidance Robot
Overview
This project implements a reactive obstacle avoidance robot using an ESP32 and an ultrasonic sensor. A PID controller dynamically adjusts motor speeds to maintain a safe distance from obstacles.

The system is simulated using Wokwi, enabling hardware-independent testing and validation.

Features
Ultrasonic distance sensing (HC-SR04)
PID-based control for smooth obstacle avoidance
PWM motor control (simulated using LEDs)
Real-time serial debugging
Fully runnable in Wokwi
System Architecture
Ultrasonic Sensor → PID Controller → Motor Control (PWM)
